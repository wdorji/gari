"February 28, 2012","One killed, two injured in vehicle accident","A 67-year-old man died in a vehicle accident in Paro on Sunday. The accident occurred at around 5:30 pm near Shaba Middle Secondary School. The alto car, the deceased was driving, collided head on with a Prado.The deceased along with three passengers including a child were travelling to Paro from Phuentsholing. One passenger is recovering at the Paro hospital while the child and the other passenger have been referred to the National Referral Hospital in Thimphu.Why accidents occur?Travelling on the Thimphu Paro highway has become much comfortable after road widening was carried out. But accidents along the highway, particularly in Isuna, are becoming a concern.Just a few weeks ago two men died after the Hiace bus they were travelling in skidded on the ice and rammed on a cliff. Recently another accident occurred but fortunately no one was injured. Last year one accident took place in the area and the year before 12 vehicles met with an accident all at a time. The cause of all these accidents according to the police is skidding on the ice.“About two to three weeks ago an accident occurred and when we went to check we found the water from the field has overflowed and spilled on to the highway. Since its cold at night it has turned into ice and the vehicle has skidded on the ice and had an accident. Recently also when an accident occurred we found it was due to skidding on the ice,” said Captain Wangyal Dorji, OC, Paro.But where did the ice come from? Residents in the area blamed on poor drainage. They said the drain was damaged during the road widening.“We have to supply water to the field. No matter how careful we are, water overflows and spills on the highway. There have been many accidents in the area. I even feel shy to supply water to my fields because everyone knows it’s my field where the water is being supplied. Many feel the accidents are caused by me,” said one of the local residents“I have seen frequent accidents occurring whenever water is supplied to the field. We are not doing it purposely,” said another.The residents said the matter has been taken up to the highest authority but nothing has been done so far.“We informed the Tshogpa who in turn informed the Gewog. The Gewog officials wrote to the Dzongkhag administration but there was no response from the Dzongkhag,” said one of the residents there, adding that they also approached Lyonpo who asked the Department of Roads to make the drain. “An engineer from the Department came and took the measurement of the drain. The Gup also came at that time. We were happy that the problem was going to be fixed but it’s more than a year and a half and nothing happened.”The engineer said it would cost Nu. 700,000 and the matter had been forwarded to Thimphu.The site engineer of the Department of Roads in Paro said an inspection was carried out in the area after they received complaint from the locality.  He said the matter was taken to the Works and Human Settlement Ministry but the Ministry said that they do not have a budget.","['around 5:30 pm', 'night']", around 5:30 pm near Shaba Middle Secondary School,no metre height

Last year as well, drink driving was the main cause of the accident in Thimphu with more than hundred cases registered.“In the core town area, accidents happen because of drink-driving.

"October 16, 2019",Motor vehicle accidents on the rise in the country,"The number of Motor vehicle accidents in the country is increasing every year. The Road Safety and Transport Authority (RSTA) recorded 1450 road accidents in the year 2018-2019.This according to the authority, is an increase of about three hundred road accidents compared to the statistics of the year 2017-2018.As per the report, the traffic accidents claimed 110 lives during the year 2017-2018 and 109 lives during 2018-2019. And due to road accidents, although the number of deaths almost remained the same, the number of people injured has increased from 557 in 2017-2018 to 692 during the year of 2018-2019.According to an official from RSTA, today, human error is one of the main reasons for the road crashes in the country.“Human error in the sense it’s the behaviour of the road users. If we talk about the motorists, it’s about over speeding, drink driving, using mobile phones or any hand-held devices while driving. These are some of the main causes and also driving without a license. If someone doesn’t have a license but still when you are out of surveillance of the law then you tend to drive because you know how to drive but you do not know the rules. So when you encounter people who know the rules and when you do not know the rules, then it leads to road crashes,” said Sonam Dhendup, a Programme Officer at RSTA.The report also states that of the total Motor vehicle accidents recorded, the majority of accidents happened in Chhukha Dzongkhag. Almost 35 per cent of the accidents occurred between Thimphu-Phuentshogling highway followed by Thimphu Jurisdiction with 20 per cent.“If we look at the figure, most of the cases are in Chhukha, so when we talk about Chhukha, I think the sole reason for having such a huge number is because Thimphu-Phuentshogling highway is one of the busiest highways in our country and its one of the commercial highways. And if you talk about Thimphu, Thimphu has 45 per cent of vehicle population, so when there are too many vehicles, so accidents, road crashes are likely to happen,” he added.He further added, to reduce road fatalities, the authority plans to enhance the frequency of inspections on the highways and create awareness on road safety.Pema Seldon Tshering",[],istics of the year 2017-2018,no metre height

It played a big role in traffic accidents. But now it is more of human errors where we don’t take safety seriously. Drink driving is a major issue, and speeding is another cause.

The number of vehicles using the road increased after the highway at Trailing was closed down about two months ago. The residents are hoping the Dzongkhag administration intervenes soon.This truck ferrying grocery items from Nganglam to Monggar town lost control and toppled over near the workshop area on Saturday. The driver was able to escape unhurt. About five vehicles have toppled over on this road since it became the only way to enter Monggar town.The highway at Trailing has been shut since December of last year after a portion of the highway eroded. Since then people driving towards Monggar town have had to use this road.The residents living near the road say they are concerned for their safety.“It’s dangerous especially at night when everyone is sleeping inside. I wanted to find a new apartment but finding a home is difficult in Monggar town,” said Sonam Norbu, a resident.“One of the neighbours who live right next to the road goes to a friend’s place to sleep at night. I also do the same thing sometimes,” said Dorji Tenzin, another resident.“The officials need to either speed up the work at the highway or widen the road here,” said Meto Seldon.“A truck fell below the road once but luckily it didn’t land on my home. I am still worried,” said Sonam Choden.The road is quite narrow and steep with sharp turning making it risky especially for heavy vehicles such as trucks carrying goods.“The contractor has been working hard but we don’t see much work progress so far. The highway has been closed for about three months now,” said Cheten, a trucker.According to the Dzongkhag Engineers, the works to construct a retention wall at the Trailing highway took more time due to a dispute with the contractor.

On Sunday evening, a Jumbo truck lost control and fell off the road and partially damaged a two-storied house. The residents are hoping for the Dzongkhag Administration to intervene soon. The stretch of the road recorded about ten accidents since last year.At 10 pm on Sunday, a truck toppled on the roof of a house that is located just below the junction of the road. Fortunately, the tenant was not in the house. But some of the properties were damaged.About two weeks ago, a truck ferrying grocery items also veered off the road near the workshop area.According to the residents, the road is quite narrow and steep with sharp turning making it risky especially for heavy vehicles carrying goods.“I constructed my house in 1992 but the road was constructed in 2009 only. While constructing the road, I had even requested the Dzongkhag officials to construct the road as per the map. But the municipal officials said the road will be convenient,” said Sonam Dorji, the house owner.He said he had submitted several letters to the Dzongkhag Administration for intervention. But he is yet to receive any response.People use the two-kilometre road along Trailing and Jarung Khashor Chorten as an alternate route between the workshop area and Monggar town.“If such accidents continue, it is risky. No one looks into our matter even though we raised our concerns. Dzongkhag officials get irritated when we raise the issue time and again,” added the house owner.Meanwhile, according to the Dzongkhag engineers, the contractor who is carrying out the widening and blacktopping of the road was asked to widen the stretch at the junction.The contractor, on the other hand, said he didn’t receive any information from the Dzongkhag.The Dzongkhag Administration awarded the road widening and blacktopping work in the periphery of Monggar town to a contractor in June 2020. The two-kilometre road stretch falls under the contract package.The project was supposed to complete by the end of last month.

"June 29, 2023",DANTAK takes measures to minimise vehicle accidents on Trashigang-Wamrong Highway,"As part of their commitment to road safety, Project DANTAK is undertaking several initiatives to reduce vehicle accidents along the Trashigang- Wamrong Highway. They are installing 25 kilometres of crash barriers and other precautionary measures in accident-prone areas to make the highway safe for all motorists.The Trashigang police reported 27 vehicle accidents since 2021, with a majority of them occurring between the Khaling and Yonphula areas.One of the main causes of these accidents, apart from mechanical failure is attributed to overspeeding, sleep driving and using mobile phones.Furthermore, the presence of free-roaming cattle along the highway, particularly during foggy weather, poses an additional risk.“Sometimes I often observe drivers using only one hand to drive while holding a mobile phone with the other hand. However, I cannot ascertain the exact cause of these vehicle accidents,” said Tshewang Tenzin, a resident of Khaling Gewog.“In summer, when it rains, the road becomes foggy and visibility is poor, leading to accidents. To address this issue, I would suggest installing a flickering lighting system specifically in accident-prone areas rather than in the town. Such a system would be beneficial. Additionally, there is a need for clear white road markings to improve visibility and minimise accidents,” said Tshering Dendup, a motorist from Yangnyer Gewog.“Late-night travel can sometimes make drivers sleepy, increasing the risk of accidents. However, having crash barriers can provide protection. If a driver unintentionally hits a crash barrier, it serves as a warning and helps to prevent accidents,” said Jigme, another motorist from Chaskhar village in Monggar.The DANTAK officials added that they are working closely with the Bhutanese government to make the eastern highway a ‘Zero Fatality Corridor’. And a budget of Nu 250 M has been allocated for this purpose. A two-kilometre crash barrier is completely out of the planned 25 kilometres.Additionally, they will install reflective and solar delineators, cat eyes and thermo-reflective paint for road markings, particularly in foggy areas.The project commenced earlier this year and is expected to be completed by mid-2024.Sonam Darjay, TrashigangEdited by Sonam Pem",[],ives to reduce vehicle accidents along the Trashigang- Wamrong Highway,kilo
"July 17, 2023",Road Safety and Transport Regulations to hold pedestrians liable for accidents in urban expressways,"If you are hit by a passing car while crossing a road without a zebra crossing in an urban expressway, you are not just a victim but will now also be liable for penalties. This is according to the Road Safety and Transport Regulations 2021 which the Traffic Division of the police plans to implement soon in light of the increasing cases of pedestrian accidents. The authorities fear it will keep increasing posing risks to more lives if they do not start implementing the regulations. Previously, the authorities penalised only the drivers in such incidences.While some drivers in Thimphu accuse pedestrians of being careless while crossing the roads, others said hedges planted on dividers along the expressway are also leading to such accidents.“There is an increasing number of accidents in Thimphu. I think it is because the people are not using the zebra crossings, most of the time. When they suddenly appear from nowhere, the drivers lose control of their car resulting in accidents,” said Thinley Dorji, a driver.“There are hedges planted on the road dividers along the expressway in Thimphu Thromde. This is blocking the vision of the drivers. We cannot see clearly when children try to cross the road through the hedges,” said Phurpa Wangdi, another driver.The Traffic Division said they will now start penalising offenders based on the Road Safety and Transport Regulations 2021. Chapter six of the regulation states that a person driving a motor vehicle shall not be liable for the death or injury of a pedestrian caused by an accident due to the carelessness of the pedestrian.The number of pedestrian accidents along the expressway in Thimphu alone reached around 18, so far this year. Of them, three occurred on zebra crossings.However, pedestrians have their sides of the story to share. Some say that the drivers speed up even on zebra crossings while others added that the markings of zebra crossings in some stretches are worn out and can barely be seen.“It is obvious that many accidents are occurring at Babesa. The zebra crossings in the area are very far from each other. Especially, here where the bus stops, there is no zebra crossing and we have to run to cross the road,” said Kencho Gyeltshen, a resident.“Although we use zebra crossings, sometimes the cars come on full speed. At times, they do not stop the car even when we are walking on the zebra crossing. Forget about the fear of accidents when we do not use the zebra crossings, it is dangerous for us even when we use the zebra crossings,” said Chimi Seldon, another resident.Meanwhile, the Thimphu Thromde says that the zebra crossings are repainted whenever required but they start fading due to continuous vehicle movement and rain.They also added that the hedges should not be a barrier for the drivers as they are trimmed at a height of one to two feet for visibility.The traffic division plans to create awareness among the public regarding the regulation before implementation. They added the rule applies to all pedestrians regardless of whether it involves a pedestrian accident or not.Namgay DemaEdited by Phub Gyem",[],ions 2021 which the Traffic Division of the police plans to implement soon in light of the increasing cases of pedestrian accidents,no metre height

If they drive carefully, then naturally, the road casualties will reduce,” said Karma Pemba, Chief Transport Officer of RSTA.Globally around 1.2 million people die every year and 50 million are injured in road traffic crashes.

It includes five pillars of improving road safety management, ensuring safer roads and vehicles among others.“We ensure through regular fitness inspections that older vehicles do not ply on the road because these will again lead to more accidents and crashes. The first priority we give is to save lives,” added Karma Pemba. “Once the accident happens, we hastily coordinate with the Health Ministry and save lives and then focus on severe injuries.”The authority has also provided refresher course on road safety and traffic discipline to over 5,000 people across the country.Today, there are close to 90,000 vehicles in the country.",[],"her and human error, which includes speeding, drink driving, carelessness and un-licensed driving, were the major causes of vehicle accidents",no metre height

"January 19, 2018",Road traffic accidents down by 40 per cent,"In spite of increase in the number of vehicles in recent years, injury from road traffic accidents declined by 40 per cent in the country. This is primarily due to intensified enforcement by Road Safety and Transport Authority, Royal Bhutan Police and better roads infrastructure. This is further expected to improve as stakeholders step up its regulations in coming years.In less than eight years since Bhutan became a party to the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, the number of road accidents has reduced. In the country, 10 per cent of the non-communicable diseases death is due to injuries, mostly road traffic accidents.“Road traffic accidents have reduced; we have targeted 10-20% reduction in 2020. But as of now since 2011, we see that the road traffic accidents have reduced by almost about 40 per cent,” said Dr. Karma Lhazeen, the Director of Department of Public Health. “We have achieved that probably due to good enforcement, better roads that have been constructed by the relevant sectors.”Also to achieve this target, WHO SEARO emphasised the importance of gathering more and better data on road safety incidents. The WHO indicates good data allows authorities to analyse and understand the factors causing road crashes, as well as to devise and implement cost-effective solutions. However, the challenge at present is due to gaps in the information that are collected in the country.“In terms of challenges, sharing of information between the sectors because RSTA they collect a set of information, Health Ministry collect on the injury and deaths, there are different sources of information,” added Dr. Karma Lhazeen, which deprives them of concrete information needed to assess the decade of action impacts. However, the relevant stakeholders (RSTA, Police and Health Ministry) are working towards improving the system of information sharing.As per the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals, countries are striving to halve the number of deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020.",[],ions in coming years,no metre height
